// NEVER GENERATE YOUR OWN SVGS, GET THEM FROM THE INTERNET VIA WEBSEARCH OR PLAYWRIGHT MCP, THEN  USE OUR HANDY IMAGE TO SVG SCRIPT TO MAKE THE IMAGE ICON LOCATED AT:
/Users/gurindersingh/Documents/Developer/Gurinder-Singh-Resume/scripts/image-to-svg.js

After you complete a fix, or even one Icon generation, verify it works by using playwright mcp headed to go to the webpage, scroll down to where that image/icon is visible, then take a screenshot and save it before marking the task complete. Analyze yourself if what we made looks legit or was made manually.

For example:
[z-ai-resume-final.html] had an incorrect implementation for the following under 'CLOUD, DEVOPS, & RELIABILITY' :
AWS,AWS Lambda, EC2, IAM.

Here's an example of proper Icon usage in [KiloCode-Resume/skills-catalog.html]
